#ifndef TRAJECTORY

/**
    A Trajectory holds all the atoms, their atomic properties, and where they
    all are for each available snapshot. The Topology class is primarily
    responsible for holding all of the atomic and bond information, whereas
    this class provides access to a Topology instance as well as access to
    a list of PositionMaps. PositionMaps are a mapping (using a hashtable) of
    atoms to their positions. This allows for direct and efficient lookup
    of an atom's position without needing to know the atom's index, which can
    be useful for certain algorithms such as the ones in ProteinAnalysis.cpp.
