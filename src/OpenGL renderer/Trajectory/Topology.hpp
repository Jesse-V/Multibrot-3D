/**
    The Topology class holds a list of atoms and the bonds between them.
    An Atom is simply an instance of the Atom class, whereas a Bond is a
    std::pair of shared pointers to two of those instances. This allows
    an algorithm to quickly gain information about the two connected atoms
    without having to look them up in a list by their indexes.
