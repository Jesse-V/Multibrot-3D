#ifndef VIEWER
#define VIEWER

/**
    The Viewer class performs high-level tasks for setting up and managing
    the application as a whole. The Viewer is a singleton, but when constructed
    it uses the FAHClientIO class to load trajectory information from FAHClient,
    constructs SlotViewers, and adds Lights and a Camera to the Scene. It also
    has an update and render method to implement a simple gameplay loop.
    It uses the update method to ask the SlotViewers to animate or step forward
    the amount of time since the last time the update method was called.
