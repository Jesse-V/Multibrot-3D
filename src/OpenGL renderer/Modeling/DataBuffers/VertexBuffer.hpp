#ifndef VERTEX_BUFFER
#define VERTEX_BUFFER

/**
    A VertexBuffer contains a set of points in 3D space. These help define
    the shape of a Mesh. A VertexBuffer can be drawn by itself when using an
    IndexBuffer is not appropriate, but it is often a better idea to use
    an IndexBuffer in conjunction with a VertexBuffer to define a Mesh.
    A VertexBuffer has GLSL data GPU-side: each vertex is given a 3D vector that
    defines its position in model-space.
