/**
    An Image holds raw character data that represents a 2D sprite.
    Images can either be loaded from .bmp or .png files, but the net
    result is the same. When the image is read from the disk,
    it's then ready to be given to OpenGL for use. Images are commonly used
    for texture mapping in 2D or 3D, or for bump mapping a 2D surface.
