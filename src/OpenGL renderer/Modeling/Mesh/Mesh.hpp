#ifndef MESH
#define MESH

/**
    A Mesh contains the set of simple polygons that comprise a representation
    of a real-world object. A Mesh must contain a VertexBuffer, which defines
    the set of points in space the make up the Mesh. A Mesh can optionally have
    an IndexBuffer, which construct a set of simple polygons from these points.
    For example, if GL_TRIANGLES is the rendering mode passed to Mesh::draw,
    a Mesh could define a square by just a VertexBuffer of
    {(0, 0), (1, 1), (0, 1), (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1)} which would tell OpenGL
    to render the two triangles defined by the three sets of points.
    Alternatively, a Mesh initialized with both a VertexBuffer and an IndexBuffer
    would be {(0, 0), (1, 1), (0, 1), (1, 0)} and {(0, 1, 2), (0, 3, 1)}.
    The memory benefits get more significant with more complex models where
    a vertex is used to help define more than one face. A Mesh can be
    rendered as a cloud of points or a wireframe (depending on the mode passed
    to Mesh::draw) but is most often drawn with GL_TRIANGLES.
    Note that "glEnable(GL_CULL_FACE); glCullFace(GL_BACK);" prevents OpenGL
    from drawing triangles that are not facing the viewer, a significant
    rendering optimization.
