    A Triangle is defined by three points: a, b, and c.
    Here is a Triangle does not represent these points as locations
    in 3D or 4D space, but rather as references to these points.
    For example, a Triangle could contain {17, 12, 39}, which would be
    indices corresponding to the 17th, 12th, and 39th point, respectively.
